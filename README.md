# UnCaster

Sample app for [Compose Desktop](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose/).

Changed the project structure from multiplatform to only desktop. 
Multiplatform support with compose in intellij is really buggy at the moment.

**Work in progress.**

Design inspired from https://heycoaster.com/images/app-main.jpg.
